# sym - Merge counts of symmetric CpGs

## Synopsis
```
$ dnmtools sym [OPTIONS] <input.meth>
```

## Description

Since symmetric methylation level is the common case for CpG
methylation, we have designed all of our analysis tools based on
symmetric CpG sites, which means each CpG pair generated by
[counts](../counts) should be merged to one. The
`symmetric-cpgs` program is used to merge those symmetric CpG pairs.
It works for methcounts output with either all cytosines or CpGs only
(generated with `-n` option when running `methcounts`).

```
$ dnmtools sym -o human_esc_CpG.meth human_esc.meth
```

The above command will merge all CpG pairs while throwing out mutated
sites. Note that as long as one site of the pair is mutated, the whole
pair will be discarded. This default mode is recommended. If one wants
to keep those mutated pairs, run

```
$ dnmtools sym -m -o human_esc_CpG.meth human_esc.meth
```

## Options

```
 -o, -output
```
output file as [counts](../counts) format (default: stdout)


```
 -m, -muts
```
include mutated CpG sites, i.e. entries with an "x" at the end of the
fourth column

```
 -v, -verbose
```
print more run info to STDERR while the program is running.
